Roadmap
=======
In random order:
* Filter expenses on category- and creditorname
* Apply filter to chart
* Higlight search results
* Use GMail like pagination
* Remember page when in expense edit and adding object through sidebar first
* Assign bankaccount to person
* Filter categories (and it's expenses) by person, bank_account, period
* Assign preset to selected expenses manually
* ignore multiple spaces in presets
* use regex in presets?
* Browse to next or previous expense
* Apply preset during import
* Apply preset from edit preset page
* Display atm, pos, etc. icons for expense
* Create filter for expenses:
  * 'empty' expenses
  * expenses from last week/month/...
